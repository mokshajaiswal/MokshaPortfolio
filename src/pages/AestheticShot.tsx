          <li>I wanted to click a soft dreamy look for this picture and thats why decided to click picture with a longer focal length. As this focal length allows me to capture the scene in entirety which includes with the person and the surrounding creating the balanced composition.</li>
          <li>For aperture I wanted more light into the camera, as there was less light in the environment. </li>
          <li>As this picture is clicked with hands, and I wanted to prevent any blur or motion from the subject. Also for the shutter speed I wanted enough light while ensuring clarity.</li>
          <li>This was shot in daylight, thats why low iso maintained a clear and smooth look for the image.</li>

        <h2>What the Picture Depicts</h2>
        <p>
        This photo shows a peaceful moment when I can stop and enjoy the beauty around me. I was by the river, and a big tree stood in front of me, framing the view just right. Its branches stretched out above me, casting soft shadows on the ground, and the bright green plants hugged the edge of the river.</p>
        <p>In the picture, I am wearing a light, flowing dress. I feel calm, just like the still water beside me. Behind me, you can see a bridge in the distance, reminding us that there is a world beyond this quiet place.</p>
        <p>This image represents the quiet times I can find in nature. Standing still in my dress, I feel the harmony between myself and the natural world. By having my back to the camera, the photo invites you to imagine what I see. It encourages you to think about what is beyond the river and the horizon. Itâ€™s a chance for me to pause and find peace in the simple things around me.</p>
        <p>For me, this picture means calmness and reflection. It shows how connected I am to nature. The soft edges and warm colors were made even better during editing, giving the image a dreamy feel. This scene encourages me to stop for a moment, take a deep breath, and enjoy the beauty of stillness.</p>
